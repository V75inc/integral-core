/**
 * Everything the agent is waiting on you for, in one place.
 *
 * Pending agent work was scattered across four surfaces — the inline card in
 * whichever conversation minted it, the bell modal's Approvals tab,
 * `/approvals`, and `/background-tasks` — with no single view and no shared
 * count. That is not a tidiness complaint: a staged change was once visible
 * ONLY as the inline card in its own thread, so the Approvals page said "all
 * clear" while a card sat awaiting approval in chat (the note in
 * `StagedChatApprovals` records that incident), and later in this work an
 * interrupted turn left a real staged change reachable from nowhere but
 * `/approvals`.
 *
 * This hook is the aggregate. It does not replace those pages — each section
 * links out to the full surface — it just makes "is anything waiting on me?"
 * answerable without visiting four places.
 *
 * Counting rule: **staged changes + policy approvals**. Routines are listed
 * but never counted — a scheduled task running on its own schedule is status,
 * not a request, and a badge that lights up for work nobody asked you to do
 * trains people to ignore the badge.
 *
 * Clarifying questions are NOT included, despite belonging here conceptually:
 * `/agentive/questions/pending` answers per thread, so there is no way to ask
 * "which threads have an unanswered question?" without walking every thread.
 * Adding a user-scoped listing is the prerequisite; until then, counting them
 * would mean guessing.
