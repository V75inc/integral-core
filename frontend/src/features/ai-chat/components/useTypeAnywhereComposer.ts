/**
 * Route stray keystrokes on a chat surface into the composer.
 *
 * The composer already `autoFocus`es on mount, so arriving on `/agent` or
 * opening the dock lands the caret in the right place. What did not work is
 * everything after that: click a message to copy it, tab to the scroll region,
 * dismiss a popover — focus is now on a button or the body, and typing goes
 * nowhere at all. Reported as "the chat bar should be automatically active …
 * any text entered while on the chat interface should automatically be
 * directed to the chat bar".
 *
 * Rather than fight for focus on every render (which steals it back from
 * anything the user deliberately focused, and breaks the edit-message
 * composer), this listens for the first printable keystroke that nothing else
 * wants and hands it to the composer.
 *
 * The character is replayed by setting `value` through the native setter and
 * dispatching `input`, not by relying on focus-during-keydown to redirect the
 * browser's own insertion. That behaviour differs across engines — Safari is
 * where the QA report came from — and this way one code path produces the same
 * result everywhere. Going through `input` (rather than assigning `.value`)
 * is what makes React's `onChange` fire, so the composer state, the tag
 * autocomplete and the send button all see the text.
