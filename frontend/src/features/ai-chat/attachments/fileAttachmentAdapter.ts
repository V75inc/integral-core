/**
 * General file attachment adapter for the AI chat composer (Slice B — general
 * file persistence). Unlike the image adapter (inline base64, no server
 * upload), a general file is uploaded to the chat-upload endpoint
 * (`POST /chat/threads/{id}/attachments`) at `send()` time and referenced by
 * id — the turn forwards `attachment_ids[]` so the backend builds a per-turn
 * context note (see `useAIChatRuntime`'s `attachmentIdsFromContent`).
 *
 * assistant-ui resolves every pending attachment's `send()` BEFORE calling
 * `onNew`, so on the first message of a brand-new conversation there is no
 * thread yet. `ensureThreadId` (from `useAIChatRuntime`) creates one on
 * demand in that case — the same thread `onNew` would otherwise create a
 * moment later, deduped via its own in-flight-creation guard.
